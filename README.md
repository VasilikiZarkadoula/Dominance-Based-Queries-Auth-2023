# Dominance-Based-Queries-Auth-2023

In this project, we work with multi-dimensional data. Given a potentially large set of d-dimensional
points, where each point is represented as a d-dimensional vector, we need to detect interesting points.
There are three different tasks you need to complete:


Task1. Given a set of d-dimensional points, return the set of points that are not dominated. This is also
known as the skyline set.


Task2. Given a set of d-dimensional points, return the k points with the highest dominance score. The
dominance score of a point p is defined as the total number of points dominated by p.


Task3. Given a set of d-dimensional points, return the k points from the skyline with the highest dominance
score
